I spoke to God today and she said that she's ashamed
What have I become
What have I done
I spoke to the devil today and he swears he's not to blame
And I understood 'cause I feel the same
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero and I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the righteous side of hell
The wrong side of heaven and the righteous side
The righteous side of hell:
